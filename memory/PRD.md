# JobMatch AI - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a website that helps users find jobs best suited for them based on what info they provide and automatically applies to them based off their approval. Also optimizes resumes to ATS standard based off each job, using their resume. Make a cover letter for each job and interview tips and prep.

## Core Principles (Quality-First)
- **Quality over volume**: Focus on high-quality, relevant job matches
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Users must review and approve every application before it's sent
- **Transparency**: System explains why jobs are recommended or skipped
- **Intelligent evaluation**: Roles evaluated based on relevance, industry, seniority, location, work authorization, and skill overlap

## User Choices
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-5.2 (via Emergent Universal Key)
- **Job Data Source**: JSearch API (RapidAPI) + Greenhouse + Lever (real-time scraping)
- **Authentication**: Google Social Login (Emergent OAuth)
- **Design**: Light theme with glassmorphism

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-5.2 via emergentintegrations
- **Job API**: JSearch (RapidAPI) + Greenhouse/Lever APIs
- **Auth**: Emergent Google OAuth

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/session` - Exchange session_id for session_token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout user
- `GET/PUT /api/profile` - Profile management (includes new fields)
- `POST /api/profile/resume` - Resume upload
- `POST /api/jobs/search` - Search jobs with detailed match evaluation
- `POST /api/ai/optimize-resume` - ATS optimization
- `POST /api/ai/cover-letter` - Generate cover letter
- `POST /api/ai/interview-prep` - Generate interview prep
- `GET/POST /api/applications` - Application CRUD
- `PUT /api/applications/{id}/approve` - Approve application
- `PUT /api/applications/{id}/reject` - Reject application
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics

## Match Evaluation Algorithm
The job matching evaluates candidates against jobs using:
1. **Role Relevance** (+25 points): Title alignment with target positions
2. **Skills Match** (+20 points): Ratio of matching skills in job description
3. **Experience Level** (+15 points): Seniority alignment (junior/mid/senior/director)
4. **Location Match** (+15 points): Preferred locations or remote availability
5. **Industry Match** (+10 points): Target industries or "open to any"
6. **Work Authorization Check**: Filters jobs requiring sponsorship if user needs it
7. **Salary Check** (+5 points): Salary range meets minimum requirement

## Changelog

### 2025-12 — One-page resume optimization (P0, DONE)
- `POST /api/ai/optimize-resume` (`optimize_resume` in `server.py`, ~line 2149) now enforces
  strict length rules so the optimized resume is never longer than the original and fits on one
  page in Word:
  - System prompt: same line count, each line same length or shorter, total words ≤ original,
    replace words for keywords (never append), strip markdown fences.
  - Post-processing guard `_too_long()` re-runs the LLM once with a "tighten" instruction if the
    output exceeds original line count / word count / +5% chars. Helper `_strip_fences()` removes
    accidental ``` fences.
  - Verified end-to-end (real GPT-5.2 call via seeded session): 14-line/78-word original produced
    14-line/72-word/448-char output with JD keywords injected and formatting preserved.
- Cleaned 16 bare-`except` lint errors (E722) across `server.py` and the parallel-fetch test.
- User decision: resume must NEVER be shorter than the original — only prevent it from getting longer.

### Still pending / backlog
- P1: Playwright auto-fill for Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby applications
- P1: Google Jobs as an extra job source
- P1: Refactor monolithic `server.py` into routes/services/models
- P2: Playwright-based Ashby scraper (currently placeholder/mocked)
- P3: Fetch full job descriptions, more aggregators, application status tracking, monetization
